# Weather-Dashboard

This project is titled "Weather Dashboard" and is an application designed to display the weather forecast of desired locations. Users can type in a city and upon clicking the search button, they will be presented a 5 day weather forecast with details pertaining to the location's temperature, humidity, windspeed, as well as a weather icon of the predicted weather conditions. The recent cities the user has searched for will remain in local storage and be displayed underneath the search button incase they would like to click on a previously searched city to pull up that location's weather information. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Moment.js, were needed to make this application.
